# Version Management Practices

## Current Status
- **Current Version**: 0.1.3 (pre-release development)
- **Status**: Active development, not ready for 1.0.0 release
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-28

## Semantic Versioning Strategy

### Pre-Release Versions (0.x.x)
The project is currently in **pre-release development** using semantic versioning:

```
0.1.x = Pre-release with incremental improvements
0.2.x = Pre-release with significant feature additions
0.x.x = Pre-release with API changes or major features
```

### Version Increment Guidelines

#### Patch Versions (0.1.3 → 0.1.4)
- **When**: Bug fixes, minor improvements, documentation updates
- **Examples**: 
  - Fix CLI command parsing error
  - Update test coverage
  - Improve error messages
  - Documentation corrections
- **Command**: `npm run version:patch`

#### Minor Versions (0.1.x → 0.2.0)  
- **When**: New features, API additions (backward compatible)
- **Examples**:
  - Add new console commands
  - Implement new database functionality
  - Add configuration options
  - New CLI capabilities
- **Command**: `npm run version:minor`

#### Major Pre-Release (0.x.x → 0.y.0)
- **When**: Significant architectural changes, API breaking changes
- **Examples**:
  - Database schema changes requiring migration
  - API restructuring
  - Major feature implementations
  - Breaking configuration changes
- **Command**: `npm run version:major`

## 1.0.0 Release Readiness Criteria

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Version 1.0.0 should ONLY be released when ALL of the following criteria are met:

### Release Management Completion
- [ ] **ALL Plan.md phases 1-7 completed** (currently ~5% complete)
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Release Infrastructure Setup (6/6 tasks)
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Changelog Generation System (6/6 tasks)  
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Release Automation Workflows (6/6 tasks)
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Version 1.0.0 Release Preparation (6/6 tasks)
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Release Process Documentation (6/6 tasks)
- [ ] **Phase 6**: Quality Assurance & Validation (6/6 tasks)
- [ ] **Phase 7**: Release Execution & Deployment (6/6 tasks)

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Test Success Rate ≥95%** (currently 92.6%)
- [ ] **Complete documentation** updated for production release
- [ ] **Breaking changes documented** with migration guides
- [ ] **Release validation procedures** implemented and tested
- [ ] **Rollback procedures** tested and documented
- [ ] **Post-release monitoring** processes in place

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **Semantic versioning** implementation with automated bumping
- [ ] **Conventional commits** validation with git hooks
- [ ] **Automated changelog** generation from commit history
- [ ] **Professional release notes** with categorized changes
- [ ] **Git tagging strategy** with signed releases
- [ ] **NPM publishing workflow** with access control

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. Assess the scope of your changes
2. Choose appropriate version increment (patch/minor/major)
3. Ensure changes align with current pre-release status

### Making Version Changes
```bash
# For bug fixes and small improvements
npm run version:patch

# For new features (backward compatible) 
npm run version:minor

# For breaking changes
npm run version:major

# For pre-release candidates
npm run version:prerelease
```

### After Version Changes
1. Update CHANGELOG.md with new changes in [Unreleased] section
2. Run tests to ensure version tests pass
3. Commit changes with conventional commit message
4. Document significant changes in release notes

## Preventing Premature 1.0.0 Releases

### Safeguards
1. **Plan.md Dependency**: 1.0.0 release blocked until all phases complete
2. **Quality Gates**: Automated checks prevent release below quality thresholds  
3. **Review Process**: All version bumps require validation
4. **Documentation**: Clear criteria documented (this file)

### Warning Signs of Premature Release
- Plan.md phases not completed (❌ Currently failing)
- Test success rate below 95% (❌ Currently 92.6%)
- Missing release management infrastructure (❌ Currently missing)
- Incomplete documentation or migration guides (❌ Currently incomplete)

## Future Roadmap

### Immediate Next Steps (0.1.4+)
- Complete workspace database initialization
- Finish database synchronization implementation  
- Complete resource command parsing and validation
- Improve test success rate to >95%

### Medium Term (0.2.x)
- Begin Plan.md Phase 1 implementation
- Complete release management infrastructure
- Implement automated release workflows
- Comprehensive quality assurance processes

### Long Term (1.0.0)
- Complete ALL Plan.md phases 1-7
- Achieve >95% test success rate
- Full production readiness validation
- Professional release management complete

## Version History Reference

- **0.1.3**: Current version (corrected from premature 1.0.0)
- **0.1.2**: Professional documentation and testing orchestration  
- **0.1.1**: Major codebase cleanup and architecture improvements
- **0.1.0**: Initial pre-release with core functionality

**Remember**: This project is in **active pre-release development**. Version 1.0.0 represents a **significant milestone** requiring completion of comprehensive release management processes documented in Plan.md.
