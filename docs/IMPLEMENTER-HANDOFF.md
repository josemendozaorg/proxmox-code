## Execution Framework

### Test Execution Order
1. **Foundation Phase** (Tests 001-018): Database + API + Console + Resource Management + Workspace + IaC
2. **Quality Phase** (Tests 019-027): Error Handling + Performance + Security  
3. **Experience Phase** (Tests 028-031): User Experience + End-to-End Integration

### Safety Protocol
- **Evidence Collection**: Document every test with logs, screenshots, timing data
- **Rollback Ready**: Execute rollback procedures immediately if issues occur
- **Incremental Risk**: Progress from safe read-only operations to potentially impactful ones
- **Production Safety**: Minimize impact to existing 11 VMs and 4 containers
- **Quality Gates**: Validate each phase before proceeding to next

### Success Validation
- Each test case must meet specified expected results
- Evidence requirements must be collected and documented
- Any failures must be investigated and resolved before proceeding
- Overall >90% test execution success rate required

1. **Complete execution results** for all 31 test cases
2. **Evidence collection** with logs, screenshots, and performance data
3. **Success/failure analysis** with root cause investigation for any failures
4. **Capability validation** confirming all 10 capability areas working
5. **Integration demonstration** showing complete end-to-end workflows
6. **Production readiness assessment** with recommendations

**Next Action**: Begin systematic execution of Foundation Phase tests (001-018), starting with Database Operations testing.
