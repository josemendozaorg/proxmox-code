# MCP Server Integration - Future Work

## Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation was created as forward-looking preparation for Phase 7 (Natural Language Processing) integration. However, analysis in December 2024 determined it is currently over-engineered for project needs and not integrated with the main application.

## Current State (Archived)

**Original Implementation:**
- 5 files with ~400+ lines of comprehensive MCP server implementation
- Full JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol handling with session management
- Resource/tool/prompt architecture for AI model integration
- 48 tests with 44% failure rate (21 failed tests)

**Decision to Archive:**
- No integration with main application (no imports outside MCP module)
- No official MCP SDK dependencies (custom implementation)
- Complex implementation premature for current project phase
- Focus should remain on core functionality (interactive console, resource management)

## Future Integration Plan

### When to Revisit
- **Phase 7**: When implementing natural language processing features
- **After Core Completion**: When basic infrastructure management is fully working
- **User Demand**: When there's specific need for AI model integration

### Integration Strategy
1. **Assess Official MCP SDK**: Use official SDK instead of custom implementation
2. **Minimal Viable Implementation**: Start with basic resource exposure, not full protocol
3. **Integration Points**: Connect with existing console commands and resource management
4. **Incremental Development**: Add features based on actual use cases

### Technical Considerations
- **Dependencies**: Add official MCP SDK package when ready
- **Architecture**: Integrate with existing console command system
- **Testing**: Focus on integration tests with real AI models
- **Documentation**: Clear usage examples for AI model interaction

## Archived Files Location

Files were archived in commit documenting this decision:
- `src/mcp/mcp-server.ts` - Main server implementation
- `src/mcp/mcp-resources.ts` - Resource management
- `src/mcp/mcp-tools.ts` - Tool implementations
- `src/mcp/mcp-prompts.ts` - Prompt handling
- `src/mcp/types.ts` - TypeScript definitions
- `src/mcp/__tests__/` - Test suites

## Benefits of This Decision

1. **Reduced Maintenance**: No failing tests to maintain
2. **Cleaner Codebase**: Focus on working features
3. **Faster Development**: No premature optimization overhead
4. **Better Architecture**: Can integrate properly when needed with lessons learned

This decision follows the principle: "Build what you need when you need it, not what you might need someday."
