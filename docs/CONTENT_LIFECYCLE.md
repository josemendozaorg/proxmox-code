# Documentation Content Lifecycle Management

## Overview

This document defines the lifecycle management processes for documentation content in the Proxmox-MPC project, ensuring content remains accurate, relevant, and valuable throughout its lifetime.

## Content Lifecycle Stages

### 1. Planning and Creation

**Triggers**:

- New feature development
- User feedback requesting documentation
- Gap identification in existing documentation
- Major architecture or API changes

**Process**:

1. **Need Assessment**: Identify specific documentation requirement
2. **Audience Analysis**: Define target audience and use cases
3. **Template Selection**: Choose appropriate template from `/docs/templates`
4. **Content Planning**: Outline structure and key information
5. **Creation**: Write content following documentation standards

**Deliverables**:

- Content outline
- Draft documentation
- Initial review checklist

### 2. Review and Quality Assurance

**Multi-stage Review Process**:

#### Technical Review

- **Reviewer**: Subject matter expert or development team member
- **Focus**: Technical accuracy, completeness, feasibility
- **Criteria**:
  - All technical information is correct
  - Code examples are tested and functional
  - API documentation matches implementation
  - Prerequisites are complete and accurate

#### Editorial Review

- **Reviewer**: Technical writer or documentation owner
- **Focus**: Style, clarity, structure, user experience
- **Criteria**:
  - Follows documentation standards
  - Language is clear and accessible
  - Structure supports user goals
  - Formatting is consistent

#### User Acceptance Testing (for complex procedures)

- **Reviewer**: Representatives from target audience
- **Focus**: Usability, effectiveness, completeness
- **Process**: Test procedures with fresh environment

**Quality Gates**:

- [ ] Technical accuracy verified
- [ ] Style guide compliance confirmed
- [ ] User testing completed (if applicable)
- [ ] All links functional
- [ ] Examples tested

### 3. Publication and Release

**Publication Process**:

1. **Final Approval**: Documentation owner approves for publication
2. **Version Control**: Commit to main branch with descriptive message
3. **Build and Deploy**: Automated build and deployment via MkDocs
4. **Announcement**: Notify stakeholders of new/updated content
5. **Metrics Baseline**: Establish usage and feedback metrics

**Release Integration**:

- Documentation updates are part of feature releases
- Breaking changes require documentation updates before code release
- Release notes reference relevant documentation updates

### 4. Maintenance and Updates

**Regular Maintenance Schedule**:

#### Monthly Reviews

- **Scope**: High-traffic, critical user-facing content
- **Activities**:
  - Verify links and references
  - Check for outdated information
  - Review user feedback and issues
  - Update version-specific information

#### Quarterly Reviews

- **Scope**: All documentation content
- **Activities**:
  - Comprehensive content audit
  - Usage analytics review
  - Content gap analysis
  - Template and standard updates

#### Annual Reviews

- **Scope**: Documentation strategy and structure
- **Activities**:
  - Information architecture review
  - User journey optimization
  - Tool and process evaluation
  - Style guide updates

**Triggered Updates**:

- **Code Changes**: Update documentation for API/feature changes
- **User Feedback**: Address reported issues and gaps
- **Support Tickets**: Document solutions for recurring issues
- **Environment Changes**: Update setup and configuration guides

### 5. Evolution and Optimization

**Content Evolution Triggers**:

- User behavior changes
- Technology stack updates
- Feature deprecation or replacement
- Performance and accessibility improvements

**Optimization Process**:

1. **Analytics Review**: Analyze usage patterns and user feedback
2. **Content Assessment**: Evaluate effectiveness and relevance
3. **Improvement Planning**: Identify specific optimization opportunities
4. **Implementation**: Execute improvements following standard process
5. **Impact Measurement**: Track improvement effectiveness

### 6. Deprecation and Archival

**Deprecation Criteria**:

- Feature or API is deprecated
- Content is no longer accurate or relevant
- Superseded by newer, better content
- Low usage with high maintenance cost

**Deprecation Process**:

1. **Assessment**: Confirm content should be deprecated
2. **User Communication**:
   - Add deprecation notice to content
   - Provide alternative resources
   - Set end-of-life date
3. **Transition Period**: Maintain content with deprecation warnings
4. **Archival**: Move to archive location with redirect
5. **Cleanup**: Remove deprecated content after transition period

**Archival Standards**:

- Maintain archived content for historical reference
- Include clear archival date and reason
- Preserve links through redirects when possible
- Document replacement content path
