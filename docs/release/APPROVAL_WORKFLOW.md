### Decision Escalation Process

#### Approval Conflicts Resolution

When stakeholders have conflicting opinions or requirements:

1. **Document Conflict**: Record specific disagreements and rationale
2. **Facilitate Discussion**: Schedule stakeholder meeting to resolve
3. **Technical Lead Decision**: For technical conflicts, Technical Lead has final authority
4. **Product Owner Decision**: For feature/UX conflicts, Product Owner has final authority
5. **Release Manager Escalation**: Escalate to project leadership if unresolved

#### Timeline Escalation

When review timelines are at risk:

1. **24-hour Warning**: Remind stakeholders of approaching deadline
2. **Emergency Review**: Reduce review scope to critical items only
3. **Conditional Release**: Release with post-deployment review for non-critical items
4. **Release Postponement**: Delay release if critical approvals missing
