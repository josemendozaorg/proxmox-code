# Phase 10: Web Dashboard - Comprehensive Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Overview

**Project**: Proxmox-MPC Phase 10 Web Dashboard Implementation
**Timeline**: 8 weeks (6-8 weeks as specified in PLAN.md)
**Approach**: Multi-agent orchestration with specialized implementation teams
**Foundation**: Building on v1.0.0 production-ready architecture (96.8% test success rate)

### **Strategic Objectives**

1. **Professional Web Interface**: Modern React dashboard matching console capabilities
2. **Real-time Infrastructure Management**: WebSocket-powered live updates
3. **Seamless Integration**: Unified architecture supporting both console and web interfaces
4. **Production Quality**: >80% test coverage, security compliance, performance optimization

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Current Asset Leveraging**

**Existing Strengths to Build Upon:**
- `src/api/`: Mature Proxmox API client with authentication and SSL handling
- `src/database/`: Comprehensive Prisma ORM with repositories for all resources
- `src/console/`: Proven command system with business logic
- `src/generators/`: Terraform/Ansible IaC generation capabilities
- `src/observability/`: Professional logging, metrics, and diagnostics
- Express.js already in dependencies for API framework

**New Architecture Components:**
```

```

### **Shared Service Layer Strategy**

**New Unified Services Architecture:**
```typescript
src/services/               # Shared business logic
├── vm-service.ts          # VM operations (console + web)
├── container-service.ts   # Container operations
├── infrastructure-service.ts # Infrastructure management
├── auth-service.ts        # Web authentication
├── websocket-service.ts   # Real-time updates
└── config-service.ts      # Configuration management
```

This maintains single-source-of-truth while enabling both interfaces to use identical business logic.
