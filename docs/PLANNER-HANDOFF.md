# Planner Agent Handoff: Detailed Test Case Creation

**Mission**: Create comprehensive test cases for all 10 Proxmox-MPC capability areas with specific procedures, expected outcomes, and validation criteria.

**Context**: Building on successful Phase 1 safe testing with real Proxmox server (192.168.0.19:8006), now need systematic test cases for complete product validation.

## Planner Agent Requirements

### Core Deliverable
Create a detailed test specification document with specific test cases for each of the 10 capability areas:

1. **Interactive Console System** üñ•Ô∏è
2. **Resource Management Operations** üèóÔ∏è 
3. **Database Operations & State Management** üóÑÔ∏è
4. **Proxmox API Integration** üåê
5. **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Generation** üìù
6. **Project Workspace Management** üìÅ
7. **Error Handling & Recovery Systems** üîÑ
8. **Performance & Scalability** ‚ö°
9. **Security & Safety Validation** üõ°Ô∏è
10. **User Experience & Documentation** üìñ

### Test Case Specification Format
For each capability area, provide:

#### Test Case Structure
```yaml
test_id: CAP-XX-YY
capability_area: [Area Name]
test_name: [Descriptive Test Name]
priority: [P0/P1/P2]
risk_level: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
prerequisites: [Required setup/conditions]
test_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: [Specific action to perform]
    expected_result: [What should happen]
    validation: [How to verify success]
safety_measures: [Specific safety protocols]
rollback_procedure: [How to undo if needed]
evidence_required: [What to document/capture]
estimated_time: [Duration estimate]
dependencies: [Other tests that must pass first]
```

### Real Infrastructure Context
**Known Environment**:
- Proxmox server: 192.168.0.19:8006
- Working API connection established
- 11 VMs discovered and mapped
- 4 containers discovered and mapped
- Database schema validated with real data
- Safe testing methodology proven in Phase 1

### Safety-First Approach Requirements
- **Start with read-only operations** - Discovery and analysis before modifications
- **Incremental complexity** - Simple operations first, complex workflows later
- **Rollback capability** - Every test must have clear rollback procedure
- **Production safety** - Minimize risk to existing infrastructure
- **Evidence collection** - Document all test executions with logs/screenshots

### Priority Classification
- **P0**: Critical functionality that blocks other capabilities
- **P1**: Core user workflows and primary features
- **P2**: Enhancement features and optimization capabilities

### Test Categories to Address

#### Foundation Tests (Enable all other capabilities)
- Database CRUD operations with real Proxmox data
- API connectivity and authentication validation
- Console REPL functionality and command routing

#### Feature Tests (Primary user workflows)
- VM/Container create, read, update, delete operations
- Project workspace initialization and management
- Infrastructure discovery and synchronization

#### Quality Tests (Production readiness)
- Error handling for all failure scenarios
- Performance under load and optimization
- Security validation and safety protocols

#### Experience Tests (Professional product quality)
- User interface and help system effectiveness
- Documentation accuracy and completeness

## Handoff to Implementer Agent

After completing the test specification, the Planner will hand off to the Implementer agent with:

1. **Complete test specification document**
2. **Execution priority matrix**
3. **Safety protocol requirements**
4. **Success criteria and validation methods**
5. **Evidence collection requirements**

The Implementer will then systematically execute all test cases with the real Proxmox infrastructure, following the proven safe methodology established in Phase 1.

**Next Action**: Planner agent should now create the comprehensive TEST-SPECIFICATION.md document with detailed test cases for all 10 capability areas.
