## Safety Framework & Risk Mitigation

### Production Safety Protocol
- **Read-Only First**: All discovery and analysis operations before any modifications
- **Incremental Testing**: Start with single resources, expand gradually
- **Rollback Capability**: Every operation must have clear rollback procedure
- **Backup Verification**: Ensure backups exist before any destructive operations
- **Resource Isolation**: Use test VMs/containers when possible
- **Change Validation**: Verify each change before proceeding to next test

### Risk Assessment Matrix
| Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy | Example |
|------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Low** | Standard testing protocol | Resource listing, status checks |
| **Medium** | Backup + validation checkpoint | Configuration changes, updates |
| **High** | Test environment + staged rollout | VM creation, network changes |
| **Critical** | Manual approval + backup verification | Production infrastructure changes |

### Emergency Response Plan
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Stop testing, isolate affected systems
2. **Damage Assessment**: Identify scope of impact and affected resources
3. **Recovery Execution**: Execute rollback procedures and restore from backups
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate failure cause and improve safety protocols
5. **Prevention Update**: Update testing framework to prevent similar failures

## Next Steps: Planner Agent Engagement

The Planner agent should now create detailed test cases for all 10 capability areas, providing specific procedures, expected outcomes, and validation criteria for each capability. This will enable systematic testing of every Proxmox-MPC feature with the proven safe methodology established in Phase 1.

**Priority Focus**: Start with Foundation capabilities (Database + API + Console) as they enable all other capabilities, then proceed through the systematic phase approach outlined above.
