# Natural Language Interface Implementation Plan

## üéØ Overview
Implement seamless Claude Code integration for natural language infrastructure commands in proxmox-mpc console following TDD methodology.

## üìä Current Status
- **‚úÖ 7/18 tests passing** - Basic functionality works
- **‚ùå 8/18 tests failing** - Advanced features need implementation  
- **‚è≠Ô∏è 3/18 tests skipped** - Integration tests for later

## üöß Implementation Strategy

### **TDD Approach**: Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor
1. **Red**: Confirm test fails
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass test
3. **Refactor**: Clean up and optimize
4. **Commit**: Save progress with descriptive message
5. **Iterate**: Move to next failing test
