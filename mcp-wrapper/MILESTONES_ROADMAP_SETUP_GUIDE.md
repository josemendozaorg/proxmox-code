# 🗺️ Milestones & Roadmap Setup Guide

## Complete Guide to Creating Project Milestones and Roadmap Views in GitHub Projects

This guide provides both automated setup via API and manual configuration steps for creating professional project roadmaps and milestone tracking.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ Epic issues created (#79-#83)
- ✅ Epic views system implemented
- ✅ Custom fields created for epic management
- 🌐 Access to GitHub Project: https://github.com/users/josephrichard7/projects/4

## 🤖 Step 1: Automated Setup

**Run the automated milestone and roadmap creation:**

```bash
npm run create-milestones-roadmap
```

This automated script creates:

### ✅ Project Milestones - AUTOMATED via REST API

**5 Phase-Based Milestones Created:**

1. **🏗️ Phase 1-6: Foundation (COMPLETED)**
   - Status: `closed` (completed)
   - Due Date: 2024-12-31
   - Description: Core infrastructure complete

2. **📊 Phase 7: Advanced Observability**
   - Status: `open` (in progress)
   - Due Date: 2025-01-31
   - Description: Monitoring and logging systems

3. **🤖 Phase 8: MCP & AI Integration**
   - Status: `open` (planned)
   - Due Date: 2025-02-28
   - Description: AI integration and MCP server

4. **🏢 Phase 9: Enterprise Features**

5. **🌐 Phase 10: Dashboard & Success Metrics**
   - Status: `open` (planned)
   - Due Date: 2025-04-30
   - Description: Web interface and success metrics

### ✅ Timeline Fields - AUTOMATED via GraphQL API

**Date Fields Created:**
- `Start Date`: When work on item begins
- `Target Date`: Expected completion date
- `Actual Completion`: When item was completed

**Iteration Field Created:**
- `Sprint Timeline`: 6-month sprint schedule with 30-day iterations

### ✅ Issue Assignment - AUTOMATED

All epic issues automatically assigned to their corresponding phase milestones based on epic labels.

## 🔧 Step 2: Manual Roadmap View Creation

**Roadmap views cannot be created via GitHub API** - they must be created manually in the UI.
