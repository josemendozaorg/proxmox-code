Title: [Release] Proxmox-MPC v1.0.0 - Interactive Infrastructure-as-Code Console for Proxmox VE

Hey r/ProxmoxVE! 

I'm excited to share Proxmox-MPC v1.0.0, a production-ready tool I've been developing that brings Infrastructure-as-Code practices to Proxmox VE management.

## What is Proxmox-MPC?

Think "Claude Code for Proxmox" - it's an interactive console that lets you manage your Proxmox infrastructure through natural language commands while automatically generating Terraform and Ansible configurations.

```bash
$ proxmox-mpc                           # Launch interactive console
proxmox-mpc> /init                      # Initialize project workspace
proxmox-mpc> /sync                      # Import existing infrastructure as IaC
proxmox-mpc> create vm --name web-01    # Generate Terraform/Ansible configs
proxmox-mpc> /test                      # Validate infrastructure changes
proxmox-mpc> /apply                     # Deploy to Proxmox server
```

## Key Features

üéÆ **Interactive Console** - Familiar slash command interface like popular dev tools
üìÅ **Project Workspaces** - Each directory becomes a self-contained Proxmox project
üèóÔ∏è **Automatic IaC Generation** - Generates Terraform + Ansible from existing infrastructure
üß™ **Test-Driven Infrastructure** - Creates and runs tests before deployment
üîÑ **State Synchronization** - Bidirectional sync between server and local database
üåç **Multi-Server Support** - Export configurations for infrastructure replication

## Production Ready

- **96.8% Test Success Rate** (509/526 tests passing)
- **TypeScript** with comprehensive error handling
- **Professional CLI** with 20+ management commands  
- **Homelab Friendly** with self-signed certificate support
- **MIT License** - completely free and open source

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g proxmox-mpc
proxmox-mpc --version  # Should show v1.0.0
```

## Use Cases

Perfect for:
- **Homelabs** - Automate your home Proxmox setup
- **Development Teams** - Reproducible test environments
- **SMB Infrastructure** - Professional VM management without enterprise complexity
- **Learning IaC** - Hands-on Infrastructure-as-Code with real infrastructure

## Documentation & Support

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/proxmox-mpc/proxmox-mpc
- **Documentation**: Complete guides and API reference
- **Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests welcome

This has been a 7-phase development project with comprehensive testing on real Proxmox infrastructure. Would love to hear your feedback and use cases!

Title: [Release] Proxmox-MPC v1.0.0 - Interactive IaC Console for Homelab Infrastructure Management

Fellow self-hosters! 

Just released v1.0.0 of Proxmox-MPC - a tool specifically designed to make Proxmox VE management as easy as modern cloud platforms.

## The Problem

Managing Proxmox VE infrastructure manually gets complex quickly:
- Manual VM/container creation through web UI
- No version control for infrastructure changes
- Difficult to reproduce setups across environments
- Hard to backup and restore complete infrastructure configurations

## The Solution

Proxmox-MPC provides a Claude Code-like interactive console that:
- Imports your existing infrastructure as Terraform/Ansible code
- Lets you create new resources through natural language commands
- Automatically tests changes before deployment
- Keeps everything in version control

## Homelab-Focused Features

‚úÖ **Self-Signed Certificate Support** - Works with homelab Proxmox setups out of the box
‚úÖ **Single Binary Installation** - `npm install -g proxmox-mpc` and you're ready
‚úÖ **Offline Capable** - Local SQLite database, no cloud dependencies
‚úÖ **Resource Efficient** - Lightweight Node.js application (~45-65MB)
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing** - 96.8% test success rate with real infrastructure validation

## Quick Example

```bash
# Install and launch
npm install -g proxmox-mpc
mkdir ~/homelab && cd ~/homelab
proxmox-mpc

# Initialize project
proxmox-mpc> /init
# Enter your Proxmox details...

# Import existing infrastructure
proxmox-mpc> /sync
# Discovers VMs/containers and generates IaC files

# Create new VM
proxmox-mpc> create vm --name pihole --cores 1 --memory 1024 --disk 8
# Generates Terraform, Ansible, and test files

# Deploy
proxmox-mpc> /apply
```

## Perfect For

- **Documentation** - Your infrastructure becomes self-documenting code
- **Backup/Restore** - Complete infrastructure backup in version control
- **Experimentation** - Test changes safely with validation
- **Scaling** - Easily replicate successful configurations
- **Team Sharing** - Share infrastructure setups with others

## Installation & Docs

```bash
npm install -g proxmox-mpc
```

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/proxmox-mpc/proxmox-mpc
- **Documentation**: Complete setup guides for homelabs

Tested extensively on Proxmox VE 8.4.1+ with various homelab configurations. MIT licensed and completely free!

What do you think? Would love to hear about your Proxmox setups and how this might help!
